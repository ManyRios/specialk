# TODO

## Tatara vb vs new

- Assume that all Tatara bridged vbtokens will have the same interface as the ones on Bokuto and Katana, so use that as interface file.

## Get other addresses

- get addresses from docs

## Rebuild and upload the contract dir

- Once all contracts are added in, rebuild and upload the new contract dir and make it multi-chain

## Add all the context to mintlify

Add the interfaces somehow to Mintlify.
